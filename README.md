Introduction
In Java 8, the Stream API allows functional-style operations on collections of data. However, sometimes the built-in methods don’t cover every use case. This project introduces custom advanced stream methods to fill those gaps and make stream processing more flexible.

These methods include:

skipUntil(Predicate)

takeWhileInclusive(Predicate)

chunk(int size)

indexFilter(BiPredicate)

pairWithNext()

groupBy(Function)

cycle(int)

zipWith()

isSorted()

Installation
To use the methods in this repository, you need to have Java 8 or higher installed on your system.

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/AdvancedJavaStreamMethods.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy
cd AdvancedJavaStreamMethods
Compile and run the project:

Ensure you have a compatible Java development environment.

Compile the Java files and run the example file to see the methods in action.

Usage
To use the custom methods, follow the examples provided in the StreamExample.java file.

Here’s an example of how to use the skipUntil method:

java
Copy
import java.util.*;
import java.util.stream.*;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Integer> list = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
        StreamUtils.skipUntil(list.stream(), n -> n > 3)
            .forEach(System.out::println); // Output: 4, 5
    }
}
Each method can be used similarly. Check the StreamExample.java for more details and usage examples.

Available Methods
Here’s a brief overview of the custom stream methods available in this repository:

skipUntil(Predicate): Skip elements until a given condition is true.

takeWhileInclusive(Predicate): Take elements until the first failure, including the element that fails.

chunk(int size): Split the stream into chunks of a specified size.

indexFilter(BiPredicate): Filter elements based on both their index and value.

pairWithNext(): Create sliding pairs of consecutive elements.

groupBy(Function): Group elements based on a given function.

cycle(int): Repeat the stream elements n times.

zipWith(): Merge two streams element-wise.

isSorted(): Check if the stream is sorted.
